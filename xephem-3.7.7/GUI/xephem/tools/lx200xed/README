What is this:

lx200xed is a daemon to connect XEphem to a Meade LX200 on a serial port. It
connects between the serial port into which the telescope is plugged and
XEphem by using its two fifos xephem_in_fifo and xephem_loc_fifo. XEphem
expects to find these fifos in a directory named fifos within its ShareDir
resource directory. lx200xed is told where they are with its -m and -g command
line options, respectively. It is told which serial port to use with its -t
option. Neither program creates the fifos; they must be created ahead of time
using mkfifo(1). XEphem does not start the lx200xed daemon, you must do that
from a command line before opening the Sky View. Using ASCII art it works like
this (this assumes the ShareDir is /usr/local/xephem):

   -----------                                                   ----------
  |  XEphem   | ---> /usr/local/xephem/fifos/xephem_loc_fifo -> |          |
  | Sky View  |                                                 | lx200xed |
  |           | <--- /usr/local/xephem/fifos/xephem_in_fifo <-  |          |
   -----------                                                   ----------
                                                                     |
								     |
								     v
                                                                 /dev/ttyS0


Testing:

To test the connection with XEphem without connecting to real hardware, use
the -e option. This emulates a telescope without needing real hardware. The
telescope starts pointing at RA/Dec 0/0 and shows a symbol there in the
Sky View. Right-clicking somewhere then clicking "Telescope GOTO" will command
the emulated telescope to move to the new location. If this works, XEphem and
lx200xed are communicating both ways correctly.

History:

As of XEphem release 3.6 this is consideredd a legacy interface. 3.6 introduces
the INDI control protocol. Drivers for a variety of devices can be found at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/indi.
