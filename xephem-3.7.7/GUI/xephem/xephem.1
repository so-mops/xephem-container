       XEphem is an interactive astronomical ephemeris program for the X
       Window System.  It provides many graphical views as well as
       quantitative heliocentric, geocentric and topocentric information for
       Earth satellites, solar system and celestial objects.

       XEphem primarily uses two directories at runtime. One is referred to as
       the Shared directory, the other as the Private directory. Shared is
       read-only and holds supporting files that can be shared among all users
       on a system. Private is writable and one is expected to exist for each
       user. See the section below on X Resources for more information about
       defining these directories.

       XEphem contains extensive context-sensitive on-line help. Virtually
       none of that help is duplicated here so go ahead and run XEphem to
       learn more. The first thing to do once XEphem is up is configure the
       browser interface. All of XEphem help is written in html and stored in
       a file named xephem.html. The first entry in the Help menu brings up a
       table of browsers and defines a command for each that will invoke the
       browser and pass it the URL and anchor of the text to display. XEphem
       comes configured to support several different browsers. If yours is
       listed, just click the button to its left and your help system should
       be working. If your browser is not listed, please check the FAQ for the
       latest news.

       Note that if you are running XEphem under cygwin on Windows, before
       starting XEphem set an environment variable XEHELPURL to the full path
       of the xephem.html file on your system using Windows path syntax (not
       cygwin paths).  This file is in the _h_e_l_p directory within the source
       directory of the master distribution.  After this is in the place, run
       xephem and it can use MS IE to display help.

       The XEphem _M_a_i_n _w_i_n_d_o_w is the master panel for setting up observing
       circumstances, time looping, and for accessing all the additional tools
       and displays.  Observing circumstances includes location, date, time,
       local magnetic deviation and atmospheric conditions (used for the
       refraction model).  Looping provides the ability to set up XEphem so
       that it automatically increments time at a desired step size and rate.
       Additional displays provide all of the graphical and quantitative
       information available, which are always computed with respect to the
       circumstances defined in the Main menu. Tools provide access to
       plotting, searching, AAVSO and much more.

       --pprrffbb displays all the built-in default resources, then exits. Some of
       them are described here.

       --iinnssttaallll controls whether XEphem will install a private colormap.
       Without this option XEphem will try to decide automatically whether it
       is necessary. To force using a private colormap, use _-_i_n_s_t_a_l_l _y_e_s_.  To
       prevent it, use _-_i_n_s_t_a_l_l _n_o_.  The default automatic behavior is
       equivalent to _-_i_n_s_t_a_l_l _g_u_e_s_s_.

       --rreessffiillee <<rreessoouurrcceeffiillee>> tells XEphem to use an alternate file for
       initial resource settings. See below for the default situation.

       --ssppllaasshh or --nnoossppllaasshh controls whether XEphem will display a progress
       window front and center while it is coming up. The choice is yours
       because this can be a useful sign of life on a slow system, or be the
       source of an annoying flash on a fast system. The setting is persistent
       so it will remain until changed.

       This menu controls access to the System log; setting up network access;
       accessing the gallery; displaying a progress meter; controlling time
       and location information remotely; and keyboard accelerators for time
       stepping.

       VViieeww

       This menu offers several graphical displays if the Sun, Earth, Moon and
       several planets; a user configurable data table; and Sky and Solar
       System views.

       TToooollss

       This menu gives access to tools which can plot any XEphem data items;
       save any data items to text files for easy export to other programs;
       enter an arbitrary function to evaluate and solve using any XEphem data
       items; access AAVSO online; show the Night at a glance; find close
       pairs of objects; convert among various astonomical coordinate systems;
       and a handy log for taking observing notes.

       DDaattaa

       This menu gives control over which objects XEphem will work with.
       Objects may be created on the fly, read from catalog files, downloaded
       from the Internet, deleted or searched. A special category of objects
       known as _F_i_e_l_d _S_t_a_r_s may be configured, which are very large catalogs
       of objects whose access has been optimized. Any number of _F_a_v_o_r_i_t_e
       objects may be defined for especially easy access in several other
       places throughout XEphem.

       PPrreeffeerreenncceess

       This menu offers several configuration choices and tools for changing
       fonts and colors used throughout XEphem.  These choices can be changed
       at runtime and saved to disk to become the new defaults.

       HHeellpp

       This menu offers overall information about XEphem; context sensitive
       help; references; version number and the Copyright statement.


XX RReessoouurrcceess
       When first started, XEphem looks for a file named ..xxeepphheemmrrcc in your
       $HOME directory. It should contain one line of the form:

       XEphem.PrivateDir: ~/.xephem

       This defines the Private directory, where XEphem will store your
       personal settings. The example line shown here, which is also the
       assumption if the file is not present, means XEphem will create and use
       a directory named ..xxeepphheemm for this purpose in your home directory.

       Within this directory a text file named XXEEpphheemm will contain all the
       Preferences that differ from those built in. One important entry
       defines the Shared directory. This is in intended for multi-user
       installations. XEphem looks here for support files. Unless defined
       otherwise, the Shared directory is ".", that is, the current directory.
