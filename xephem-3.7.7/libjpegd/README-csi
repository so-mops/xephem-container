Clear Sky Institute greatfully acknowledges using this software from the
Independent JPEG Group to make the source distribution of XEphem as portable
as possible. This directory contains only those files from the original
distribution required to build a library that supports decompression. We have
not made any substantive changes, so if you have your own libjpeg and prefer
to use it by all means go for it.
